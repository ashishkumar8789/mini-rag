Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology represent a paradigm shift in how we think about money, trust, and decentralized systems. Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency to solve the double-spending problem without requiring a central authority.

Blockchain technology provides a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple nodes in a network. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain of records. This ensures transparency, security, and resistance to tampering.

Smart contracts, introduced by Ethereum, are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and automated business processes.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a major use case, offering financial services without traditional intermediaries. This includes lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming, all operating on blockchain networks.

However, the cryptocurrency space faces challenges including regulatory uncertainty, environmental concerns related to energy-intensive mining, and security vulnerabilities. Scalability remains a significant technical challenge for widespread adoption.

The technology continues to evolve with innovations like layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) exploring the potential of blockchain for traditional financial systems.
