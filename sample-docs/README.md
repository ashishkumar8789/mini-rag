## Cross-Document Queries

These queries should pull information from multiple documents:

1. "How can technology help fight climate change?"
   - Should reference: climate-change.txt, renewable-energy.txt, electric-vehicles.txt

2. "What are the ethical concerns with emerging technologies?"
   - Should reference: gene-editing.txt, ai-basics.txt, blockchain.txt

3. "What role does energy play in future technologies?"
   - Should reference: quantum-computing.txt, electric-vehicles.txt, renewable-energy.txt

4. "How is AI being used across different fields?"
   - Should reference: ai-basics.txt, cybersecurity.txt, mental-health.txt

## Document Statistics

Each document contains approximately:
- **Words:** 250-400 per document
- **Tokens:** 300-500 per document
- **Chunks:** 1-2 chunks per document (with overlap)

## Testing Workflow

### Basic Test
1. Upload 1-2 documents
2. Ask simple questions about content
3. Verify citations appear correctly

### Comprehensive Test
1. Upload all 12 documents
2. Ask both simple and complex queries
3. Test cross-document reasoning
4. Verify performance metrics

### Performance Test
1. Upload all documents in sequence
2. Note processing time for each
3. Run multiple queries
4. Check timing and cost estimates

## Adding Your Own Documents

You can add your own text files to test:

1. Create a new .txt file
2. Add meaningful content (200-1000 words recommended)
3. Upload via the UI
4. Ask relevant questions

**Tips for good test documents:**
- Clear, focused topics
- Well-structured paragraphs
- Factual information
- 300-800 words optimal
- Avoid excessive formatting

## Batch Upload Script

To upload all documents programmatically, see API_EXAMPLES.md for batch upload scripts in JavaScript and Python.

## Expected Behavior

After uploading documents, you should see:
- Success message with chunk count
- Token usage estimate
- Processing time
- Updated document count

When querying:
- Answer with inline citations [1][2]
- Source cards below answer
- Timing breakdown (retrieval, rerank, LLM)
- Cost estimates
- Rerank scores for each source
